# Your First Open Source Project

Welcome to Your First Open Source Project, a beginner-friendly code repository where you can make your first contribution to an open source project. Our mission is to provide a safe and supportive space for everyone on their journey to becoming software developers. Whether you're new to coding or looking to gain experience in open source, this is the perfect place to start.

## How to Contribute?

Contributing is easy! Just follow these simple steps:
